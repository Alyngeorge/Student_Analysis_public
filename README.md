# Student Performance Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes student performance across various topics, categorizing students into different personas based on their accuracy and engagement. The analysis includes visualizations of performance by topic and a breakdown of student personas.

  
## Approach

- Performance categories are determined based on the accuracy: 'Bio Genius', 'Curious Learner', or 'Struggling Scholar'.
- Topics are labeled with a general category (e.g., "Biology: Human Anatomy").
- Visualizations are provided to display the average accuracy across different topics.

## Visualizations
- Bar chart showing average accuracy by topic.
- Breakdown of students by performance category.

## Insights
- Students with higher accuracy are categorized as "Bio Genius", while those with lower accuracy are "Struggling Scholars".
- This analysis helps educators understand which students excel and which topics need more focus.
